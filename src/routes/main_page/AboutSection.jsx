        My name is <b>Dewyn Liriano</b>, from the Dominican Republic. I am a
        highly passionate, dependable, self-reliant, and goal-driven person. My
        keen ability is that I'm a fast learner and "learn by doing" kind of
        person. I have experience managing small teams and seeing projects from
        their planning to their implementation.
        <br />
        <br />
        Currently, I'm enrolled in a MSc in Artificial Intelligence in the
        University of Essex Online.
